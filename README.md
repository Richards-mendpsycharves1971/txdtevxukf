Oh man, I just, I’m sitting here and I can’t get my thoughts together after The King of Kings. Like, I feel I just walked out of a battlefield, but instead of a sword, I’m holding my slightly empty popcorn bag and trying to piece together what on... I think my hands smell like popcorn and... defeat? Not defeat. Glory. That movie was just—it was too much. Too much like when I have too many massage clients back to back and my brain just goes jjjjjzarks.

Anyway, the beginning was like... a kid playing chess but the pieces were people and the soundtrack was louder than the noisy carpeted hallway of responsibility in a Monday morning headache, yaknow? Somehow it felt like they were speaking in riddles or maybe my head just isn’t on straight.

> But then there was this scene with a horse and a crown and... a whispering crowd? Maybe. It’s slipping through my fingers like warm massage oil, you get me? Had to keep reminding myself to download the movie later. I think Linda said something about it being available.

Somehow by the midpoint, I'm thinking about my lower back—the chair I mean, who designs these theater chairs? I felt like a stack of pancakes left on a tilt. The battle scenes clashing with the restless shifting of everyone too. Swords were swinging and my last cocoa butter massage client was still on my mind, how she said the scent reminded her of something, maybe victory, maybe horses, can’t remember anymore.

There was definitely something about a king... was there more than one king? All I know is that by the end my eyes felt like they’ve been used as kneading dough and the only thing clearer than those intense eye wrinkles was the feeling of relief during an unexpected pause, right before the loudest explosion? Or was it applause?

I think I’m forgetting the part where someone jumps from one rooftop to another, or was that another movie? Don’t really remember because my brain’s still blending it together like herbal teas, just different flavors of chaos and majestic stuff. You should definitely watch the movie, but consider staying away from sticky seats!
